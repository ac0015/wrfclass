# wrfclass
Initial python class that will plot WRF files, both deterministic and ensemble output. Basic variables at the surface and aloft are available currently with more to be added as the class progresses. Functions to add:

precipitable water
melting level
upper level winds
virtual temperature, theta e, theta v
olr
thickness
accumulated precipitation
precip probability (ensemble)
CAPE/CINH
LCL
Bunkers motion
0-1km shear, 0-6km shear
skewt/sounding capability
cross section capability 
precip type
Red Flag Index

Convective Plots:
ML CAPE/CINH
SB CAPE/CINH
0-1km SRH/0-6km SRH
0-1km EHI/0-3km EHI
updraft helicity
max 10-m ws
SCP
STP

# wrfclass
Initial python class that will plot WRF files, both deterministic and ensemble output. Basic variables at the surface and aloft are available currently with more to be added as the class progresses. Functions to add:

melting level
virtual temperature
thickness
accumulated precipitation
precip probability (ensemble)
CAPE/CINH
LCL
Bunkers motion
skewt/sounding capability
cross section capability 
precip type
Red Flag Index

Convective Plots:
ML CAPE/CINH
SB CAPE/CINH
0-1km SRH/0-6km SRH
0-1km EHI/0-3km EHI
updraft helicity
max 10-m ws
SCP
STP

Vertical interpolation in both pressure and height are available to produce plots of variables aloft and those that consist of two vertical levels (e.g. 0-6km shear).
